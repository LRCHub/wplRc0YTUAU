Everything I ever loved is gone
Disappeared where a fire once burned strong
Won’t let it go - Won’t let it go - This last ember
This ambitious tale begs to be told
In a world of silence, break the mold
If only I could take one more step
They say that I’m crazy, I’m insane
Wouldn’t have it any other way
And sometimes I don’t know what to do
But I make it through anyway
There are many dreams within my reach
And I came prepared for anything
Nothing’s holding me back, not a doubt in my mind stopping me this time
A fire starts! Scattering sparks
Let it burn til the world’s completely covered in ash
Just lean on me - I swear I won’t fall
I’m happy to bear the weight of it all
Faster than sin! Becoming the wind
Any storm in my way could never keep me from you
It’s hit or miss but I’ll take the risk
Even if the odds are one in a million
Burn my love and burn my heart
Until ash is all we are
I’LL JUST SPARK AGAIN
Even though I searched for you all night
In the darkest places, walking blind
Maybe it’s true - Maybe it’s true - I can’t reach you
Everything around me feels so grey
But it hasn’t always felt this way
If only I could jump back in time
I don’t need a match - I’ve got a spark
If I light the fire in my heart
Then we’ll always have a guiding light
If we get lost beneath the stars
If it doesn’t work out like we planned
I’ll be fine if I can hold your hand
Nothing’s holding me back, I have nothing to fear, now that you are here
Illuminate and light up the way
Til you no longer hear the luring voice from the dark
Don’t listen to a word that they say
You are so above them in every way
Just look ahead and never forget
That a future awaits for you in clear black and white
I won’t believe in a fantasy
Take this fake illusion and set it on fire
Love shining from afar
Just like a burning star
I’LL JUST SPARK AGAIN
There’s is so much I have lost in life,
But all against my will
I won’t watch another thing that I love fade away!
A fire starts! Scattering sparks
Let it burn til the world’s completely covered in ash
Just lean on me, I swear I won’t fall
I’m happy to bear the weight of it all
Faster than sin! Becoming the wind
Any storm in my way could never keep me from you
It’s hit or miss but I’ll take the risk
Even though the odds are one in a million
Burn my love and burn my heart
Until ash is all we are
I’LL JUST SPARK AGAIN
Love shining from afar
Just like a burning star
I’LL JUST SPARK AGAIN
